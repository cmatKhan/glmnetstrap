\title{Select Predictors Whose Coefficients Are Consistently Nonzero}
\usage{
select_predictors_by_ci(coef_df, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{coef_df}{A data frame or matrix where each column contains bootstrap
estimates for a single coefficient.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the exclusion
threshold (e.g., \code{alpha = 0.05} excludes predictors whose
coefficients cross zero in more than 5\% of bootstrap replicates).}
}
\value{
A character vector of predictor names with stable, directionally
consistent coefficients.
}
\description{
This function selects predictors based on bootstrap coefficient
distributions. For each predictor, it calculates a one-sided confidence
interval (1 - \code{alpha}) and includes predictors whose bootstrap
coefficient estimates consistently stay on one side of zero (i.e.,
either the lower bound is strictly positive or the upper bound is
strictly negative).
}
\details{
This is equivalent to selecting predictors whose coefficients do not equal
or cross zero more than \code{alpha} proportion of the time.
