\title{Select Coefficients Based on Confidence Interval Bounds}
\usage{
select_predictors_by_ci(coef_df, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{coef_df}{A data frame (or matrix) where each column contains bootstrap
estimates for a single coefficient.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the significance level
(e.g., alpha = 0.05 for a 95\% confidence interval).}
}
\value{
A character vector of selected coefficient names.
}
\description{
Given a data frame of bootstrap coefficients and a confidence level (1 - alpha),
this function returns the names of variables whose confidence intervals do not
include zero (i.e., either the lower bound > 0 or upper bound < 0).
}
